I think I have only good news for you:</p>\n<h2>Direct Contributions</h2>\n<p>\nFirst off, understand that with this app, you make actual and direct contributions to OpenStreetMap (OSM).<br/>\nAnything you contribute in this app is directly added to the map, there is no third party in-between the app and OSM infrastructure.\n</p>\n<p>\nEditing OpenStreetMap anonymously is not possible. Any changes you make (and their date and location) are attributed to your OSM user account and publicly visible on the openstreetmap.org website. Because StreetComplete should only be used for on-site survey, this reveals where and when you have used the app.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Location</h2>\n<p>\nThe app does not share your GPS location with anyone. It is used to automatically download data around you, and position the map at your location.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Data Usage</h2>\n<p>\nThis app directly communicates with OSM servers.<br/>\nBefore uploading your changes, the app checks with a <a href=\"https://www.westnordost.de/streetcomplete/banned_versions.txt\">simple text file</a> on my server to ensure that this version of the app has not been banned from uploading changes. This is a precautionary measure to be able to block versions of the app that turn out to have critical bugs from uploading corrupted data to OSM.</p>",
